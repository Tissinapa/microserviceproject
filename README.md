I suggest that you use clone method for downloading this project, if not then use download zip.

You need **Postman** https://www.postman.com/downloads/

**mongodb** https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell

to run this project, also i suggest using VSC.


## ===========Running project===========

Open **Postman** and **VSC**

Go to projects rootfile

You need to start all services one by one, open 5 terminals

In each terminal open one sub folder

**cd borrow && npm run dev**

**cd games && npm run dev**

**cd hardwares && npm run dev**
 
**cd lists && npm run dev**

**cd movies && npm run dev**

### =========== IF commands above do not work =========== ###

add this command in terminal in each sub folder

**npm init**

**npm i mongodb mongoose@6.10.0 express body-parser express-http-proxy http-proxy-middleware nodemon axios**

### =========== separate file for postman commands =========== ###
